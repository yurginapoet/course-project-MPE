# Math Physics Equations Course Project   
## Task   
### FEM for parabolic two-dimensional equation with three-layer implicit time scheme in cylindric coordinates on triangles. Linear basis functions.   

## To-do list
- [x] Check initial code
- [ ] Add sparse matrix format
- [ ] Add building of global matrix & vector in sparse format
- [ ] Add sparse matrix solver (CGM)
- [ ]  Add implicit 3-layer time scheme
- [ ]  Add 1st boundary conditionals
- [ ]  Add 2nd boundary conditionals
- [ ]  Rewrite ```main()``` so program will work
- [ ]  Refactor the code
- [ ]  Run the tests (maybe automate testing)
- [ ]  Make report

## Input files
